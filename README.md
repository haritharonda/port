Smart bins detect when they are full and alert the central system, which then sends autonomous vehicles to collect the waste. These vehicles, powered by AI, navigate the port and optimize their routes based on real-time data from IoT networks. Once the waste is collected, automated systems handle sorting and recycling, ensuring efficient processing with minimal human oversight. Some ports may even use drones for monitoring, providing aerial surveillance to ensure smooth operations.

Automated waste collection systems in ports:
                                         Automated waste collection systems in ports are innovative solutions that streamline the management of waste generated by ships and port activities. These systems typically involve underground or dockside waste collection points that use vacuum suction or automated conveyors to transport waste to central collection hubs. By reducing manual handling and improving efficiency, these systems minimize environmental impact, reduce labor costs, and enhance hygiene in ports. Here are some key features of such systems:
