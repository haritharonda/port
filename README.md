Smart bins detect when they are full and alert the central system, which then sends autonomous vehicles to collect the waste. These vehicles, powered by AI, navigate the port and optimize their routes based on real-time data from IoT networks. Once the waste is collected, automated systems handle sorting and recycling, ensuring efficient processing with minimal human oversight. Some ports may even use drones for monitoring, providing aerial surveillance to ensure smooth operations.
